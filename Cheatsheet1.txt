touch .gitignore   --( optional )
	( '.gitignore' - eg.: 'big_some_library_folder/' if you don't want to push into Github due to big size. )
	( 'touch' - to creat empty file )
touch .gitignore
	(Host github.com 
 	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_rsa)
git config --global user.name <codewithmontu>
(or)
git config --global user.name <"code with montu">

git config --global user.email <"youremail@example.com">

git init  --it initialize your project & creates a hidden .git folder

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
	
	ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <"your_email@example.com">
		(or)--Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C <"youre_mail@example.com">
	cat <generated key path> --( it will generate the 'Authentic Key' , 
		copy & past and add that in the github account settings)
	tail <path to id_rsa.pub> # Add this key to your GitHub account

git remote add origin <ssh url.git>  --( first click/select SSH & copy from the Github project 
				link Then past on git base. It  Link with the Account & Project Address )
